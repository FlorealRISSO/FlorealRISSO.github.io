            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>C's manual memory management, while powerful, can be a source of bugs and complexity. The traditional
                "malloc" and "free" paradigm demands significant cognitive overhead from developers and can lead to
                performance bottlenecks. But what if we could simplify this process? Enter FatArena, a novel approach to
                memory management that challenges conventional wisdom and offers a streamlined alternative.</p>

            <h2>The Problem with Traditional Memory Management</h2>
            <p>The standard malloc allocator is a complex beast. It juggles multiple responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allocating memory</li>
                <li>Reallocating memory</li>
                <li>Freeing memory</li>
                <li>Maintaining a list of free blocks</li>
                <li>Allocating new pages when necessary</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This complexity comes at a cost: increased CPU usage, potential for bugs, and cognitive load on
                developers. But what if we could simplify these requirements?</p>

            <h2>Introducing FatArena</h2>
            <p>FatArena is a different approach to memory management with two primary goals:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Allocate new chunks of memory efficiently</li>
                <li>Free all allocated chunks at once</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By narrowing our focus, we can create a simpler, more efficient system. But this approach comes with a
                caveat: you can't free individual chunks. This limitation, however, can lead to better code structure by
                encouraging developers to group data with similar lifetimes.</p>

            <h2>How FatArena Works</h2>
            <p>FatArena leverages a clever trick in modern operating systems: when you request a new page of memory, the
                OS doesn't immediately allocate it in RAM. Instead, it waits until the memory is actually accessed (read
                or written to). This allows us to create large, virtual buffers for specific lifetimes, flushing them
                entirely when no longer needed.</p>


            <p>Here's the basic structure of our FatArena
                <a href='https://github.com/FlorealRISSO/fatarena'>(code here)</a>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
typedef struct FatArena {
    uint8_t *addr;  // The page address
    size_t remain;  // The remaining storage
    size_t size;    // The total storage
} FatArena;
            </code></pre>

            <h2>FatArena Memory Layout</h2>
            <p>To better understand how FatArena uses memory, let's look at its layout:</p>
            <div class="mermaid">
                graph LR
                subgraph "FatArena Memory Layout"
                A[Virtual Memory] --> B[Page 1]
                A --> C[Page 2]
                A --> D[Page 3]
                A --> E[...]
                B --> F[Used Memory]
                B --> G[Remaining Memory]
                C --> H[Unused]
                D --> I[Unused]
                E --> J[Unused]
                end
            </div>
            <p>FatArena allocates virtual memory pages, but only uses what it needs. The OS only commits real memory
                when it's accessed.</p>

            <h2>Implementing FatArena</h2>
            <p>Let's look at the core function for creating a new FatArena:</p>
            <pre><code>
Bool ftnew(FatArena *a, size_t sz)
{
    pgsz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
    size_t fatsz = pgsz;
    while (fatsz < sz) {
        fatsz += pgsz;
    }

    uint8_t *pg = mmap(NULL, fatsz, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
    if (pg == MAP_FAILED) {
        return 0;
    }

    a->addr = pg;
    a->remain = fatsz;
    a->size = fatsz;
    return 1;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>This function calculates the number of pages needed, rounds up to the nearest integer, and uses mmap to
                allocate the virtual memory.</p>

            <h2>Advantages of FatArena</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplified memory management: no need to track individual allocations</li>
                <li>Improved performance: fewer system calls and no complex free-list management</li>
                <li>Reduced memory usage: pointers can be stored as integers (indexes)</li>
                <li>Encourages better code structure by grouping data with similar lifetimes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real-World Application: Streamlining Compiler Lexical Analysis</h2>
            <p>Let's dive into a practical example where FatArena shines: the lexical analysis phase of a compiler. This
                stage transforms source code into a sequence of tokens, and it's a perfect showcase for FatArena's
                efficiency. We'll use the <a href="https://github.com/ghuter/chi" target="_blank">Chi
                    Compiler</a> as our reference implementation.
            </p>

            <h3>The Traditional Approach vs. FatArena</h3>
            <p>In a traditional lexer implementation, you might create a complex list of unions or structures to
                represent different token types. Each token could have various fields to store additional information,
                like line numbers, literal values, or identifiers. This approach, while flexible, can lead to increased
                memory usage and more complex token handling code.</p>

            <p>With FatArena, we can dramatically simplify this process. Instead of a complex data structure, our lexer
                produces a simple list of integers. These integers represent either token types (as enum values) or
                indexes into our FatArena. This approach offers several advantages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Simplified Token Stream: The output is just a list of integers, making it easy to process and store.
                </li>
                <li>Memory Efficiency: We only store the essential information in the token stream itself.</li>
                <li>Fast Processing: Working with a list of integers is typically faster than processing complex
                    structures.</li>
                <li>Flexible Storage: Additional data (like literal values) are stored efficiently in the FatArena.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Efficient Token Processing</h3>
            <p>Processing this token stream becomes straightforward and efficient. Here's a simplified example of how we
                might handle tokens in the next phase of compilation:</p>

            <pre><code>
void process_tokens(int *tokens, int token_count, FatArena *arena) {
    for (int i = 0; i < token_count; i++) {
        switch (tokens[i]) {
            case TOK_IF:
                // Handle 'if' statement
                break;
            case TOK_IDENTIFIER:
                // The next token is the index in the FatArena
                char *identifier = ftptr(arena, tokens[++i]);
                // Process identifier
                break;
            case TOK_LITERAL:
                // The next token is the index in the FatArena
                char *literal = ftptr(arena, tokens[++i]);
                // Process literal
                break;
            // ... handle other token types ...
        }
    }
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>This approach offers several benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The token processing logic is straightforward and easy to understand.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> We're working with a simple array of integers, which is cache-friendly
                    and fast to process.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Adding new token types is as simple as adding new enum values and case
                    statements.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Locality:</strong> All our tokens are stored contiguously, and additional data is
                    efficiently packed in the FatArena.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Setting Up FatArena for Lexical Analysis</h3>
            <p>Here's how we might set up our FatArenas for the lexer:</p>

            <pre><code>
// Initialize our FatArenas
FatArena tokens, literals;
ftnew(&tokens, TOKENS_ESTIMATE * sizeof(int));
ftnew(&literals, LITERALS_ESTIMATE);

// Perform lexical analysis
lex_source_code(&tokens, &literals);

// Now 'tokens' contains our integer token stream,
// and 'literals' contains all string data (identifiers, literal values, etc.)
            </code></pre>

            <p>This setup allows us to efficiently store and process tokens without the overhead of complex data
                structures. The lexer can quickly append tokens and literal data, and subsequent compiler stages can
                easily access this information.</p>

            <h3>The Power of Simplicity</h3>
            <p>By leveraging FatArena in our lexer, we've transformed a potentially complex and memory-intensive process
                into a streamlined, efficient operation. This approach not only simplifies our code but also paves the
                way for better performance in later stages of compilation.</p>

            <p>The beauty of this system lies in its simplicity. By reducing our token representation to its essence - a
                series of integers - we've created a flexible, fast, and memory-efficient lexical analysis stage. This
                is just one example of how FatArena's unique approach to memory management can lead to elegant solutions
                in real-world applications.</p>


            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>FatArena offers a fresh perspective on memory management in C. By simplifying our requirements and
                leveraging OS-level optimizations, we can create more efficient and less error-prone code. While it may
                require a shift in thinking about memory allocation, the benefits in terms of performance and code
                clarity can be significant.</p>

            <p>As with any tool, FatArena isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. It's particularly well-suited for
                scenarios where you can group memory allocations by lifetime, such as in compilers, game engines, or any
                application with distinct processing phases. By understanding its strengths and limitations, you can
                make informed decisions about when and how to use FatArena in your projects.</p>
