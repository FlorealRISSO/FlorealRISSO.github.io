                <h2 id="challenge">The Challenge: France Termes</h2>
                <p>
                    As a developer who loves coding apps and websites, I've often faced a common challenge: the need for
                    a
                    database when building complex applications.
                    This typically leads to implementing a backend, which brings its own set of inconveniences – server
                    costs and cybersecurity concerns, to name a few.
                    In this article, I'll share how I managed to eliminate the need for a traditional backend in the
                    second
                    version of my web app, France Termes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    France Terme (without the 's') is a resource dedicated to terms recommended by the Commission
                    d'enrichissement de la langue française and published in
                    the Journal officiel de la République française. It's particularly useful for civil servants and
                    language enthusiasts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge arose from the fact that France Terme exports its database as an XML file. While
                    comprehensive, this format is far from ideal for building
                    a responsive web application. We needed a proper database to enable efficient searching, filtering,
                    and
                    better performance.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="solution">The Solution: A Three-Step Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    To tackle this challenge, I developed a three-step approach that allowed me to create a fully
                    functional, serverless web application:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#parser">XML Parser</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#storage">GitHub as a Storage Solution</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#database">Client-Side Database Management</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
                <p>Below is a visual representation of the architecture, from parsing the XML file to managing the
                    SQLite database client-side:</p>

                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD
                    A[France Terme XML Data] -->|Input| B[XML Parser]
                    B -->|Generates SQLite DB| C[SQLite Database]
                    C -->|Push to| D[GitHub Repository]
                    D -->|App Downloads DB| E[France Termes App]
                    E -->|Stores DB| F[Browser localStorage]
                    E -->|Checks for Updates| G[GitHub API]
                    G -->|If SHA Differs| E
                    F -->|Uses DB for Search/Filtering| E
                </div>

                <h3 id="parser">Step 1: XML Parser</h3>
                <p>
                    The first step was to create a parser that could transform the unwieldy XML file into a more
                    manageable
                    database format. I chose SQLite for this task
                    due to its simplicity and portability. The parser reads the XML file, extracts the relevant
                    information,
                    and populates a SQLite database file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This parser, which I've open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/FlorealRISSO/France-Termes-Parser"
                        target="_blank">here</a>, only needs to be run
                    when the original XML data is updated. It's a one-time process that creates a database file ready
                    for
                    use in our web application.
                </p>

                <h3 id="storage">Step 2: GitHub as a Storage Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    With our database file created, we needed a place to store it that would be accessible to our web
                    application. GitHub provided the perfect solution.
                    By hosting the database file in a GitHub repository, we gain several advantages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Version Control: Track changes to our database over time.</li>
                    <li>Easy Updates: Run the parser and push the new database file to GitHub when the original XML is
                        updated.</li>
                    <li>API Access: Use GitHub's API to check for updates programmatically.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can find the database repository <a href="https://github.com/FlorealRISSO/France-Terme-SQL-DB"
                        target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="database">Step 3: Client-Side Database Management</h3>
                <p>
                    The final piece of the puzzle is managing the database entirely on the client-side:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>On first load, the web application downloads the SQLite database file from GitHub.</li>
                    <li>The app stores this file in the browser's localStorage for offline use and faster subsequent
                        loads.
                    </li>
                    <li>On each load, the app checks the GitHub API for the current SHA of the database file. If it's
                        different from the stored version, the app downloads and stores the updated database.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD
                    A[App Starts] --> B{Is DB in localStorage?}
                    B -->|Yes| C{Is DB up to date?}

                    C -->|Yes| E[Use local DB]
                    C -->|No| D
                    D --> F[Store DB in localStorage]
                    F --> E

                <h2 id="benefits">The Benefits of Going Backend-less</h2>
                <p>
                    This approach offers several significant advantages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No Server Costs: By eliminating the need for a backend server, we avoid ongoing hosting
                        expenses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enhanced Security: With no server to attack, we reduce our security attack surface.</li>
                    <li>Offline Functionality: Once the database is downloaded, the app works entirely offline.</li>
                    <li>Simplified Architecture: Without a backend, our architecture is easier to maintain.</li>
                    <li>Scalability: This solution scales effortlessly, as each user essentially hosts their own
                        "backend"
                        in their browser.</li>

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    By leveraging modern web technologies, we've created a truly serverless solution for France Termes.
                    This
                    approach demonstrates that it's possible to
                    build complex, data-driven applications without the need for a traditional backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this solution may not suit all use cases, especially those requiring real-time data or
                    handling
                    sensitive information, it opens up new possibilities
                    for a wide range of applications.
                </p>
                <p>
